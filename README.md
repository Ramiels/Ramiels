### FAQ
  - When is [copi's things](https://github.com/Ramiels/copis_things#install-instructions) being released?
    - not any time soon :^)
  - What's with your github username?
    - [Ramiel was taken already](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Bo9A7dmt-Q)
  - What's the deal with this [Copious Modding Industries](https://github.com/Copious-Modding-Industries/) thing?
    - Wanted a place to dump a bunch of noita mods without them being directly under my name, and so others can be a part of it too
    - Also since Copi is a kind of pseudonym I use in the noita community
